# Final-Year Project Support Website — Project Documentation & Specifications

> **Brand Promise**: *"Your idea. Our expertise. Let’s build it together."*

Updated service offering, visual identity, landing-page structure, and lead-generation plan for the **Volts&Bits** final-year project support platform.

---

## 1. Project Overview & Positioning

### Overview
The website promotes a dedicated project mentorship and development service tailored for students working on final-year, capstone, research, software, AI, and IoT projects. The team helps students develop their initial concepts, investigate existing literature and systems, identify opportunities for improvement, and plan and implement practical, high-quality technical solutions.

### Primary Website Goal
Convert student visitors into potential clients or mentees through a clear call-to-action (CTA) that links directly to an intake Google Form. The initial release does not require a complex user dashboard or account management system; rather, it prioritizes a polished, fast, responsive landing page that communicates credibility and effortlessly captures project inquiries.

### Brand Positioning
A practical, hands-on project-support team helping students bridge the gap between an early idea or research problem and a planned, developed, and well-documented solution through technical mentorship and implementation support.

## 2. Visual Identity & Design System

### Visual Direction
The design draws inspiration from classic barbershop character: dark slate signage and trim, warm wood tones, bronze lettering, and marble/stone neutrals—balanced with modern teal accents to signal technology, precision, and innovation.

### Color Palette

| Color Name | Hex Code | Role | Usage Guidance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dark Slate Grey** | `#2D3741` | Primary Foundation | Hero overlay, header, footer, primary button backgrounds, and dark section containers. |
| **Light Grey / Beige** | `#D0CFC8` | Main Neutral | Background panels, section breaks, borders, and subtle card surfaces. |
| **Bronze / Gold** | `#AE824B` | Primary Accent | Headlines, key highlights, icons, dividers, and decorative accents. |
| **Light Brown** | `#A26B38` | Warm Secondary Accent | Warm cards, labels, category badges, and selected callouts. |
| **White** | `#FFFFFF` | Contrast & Breathing Room | Text on dark slate, card interiors, whitespace, and clean reading areas. |
| **Teal** | `#185B6C` | Technology Accent | Links, secondary buttons, interactive hover/focus states, and tech badges. |

### Color Balance & Accessibility Rules
- **Recommended Balance**: Dark Slate Grey and White form the main structural pair; Light Grey/Beige is used for broad background panels; Bronze/Gold provides focal emphasis; Teal and Light Brown are used sparingly as supporting accents. Avoid using all six colors at equal intensity.
- **Accessibility & Contrast**:
  - Always verify WCAG AA compliance.
  - White text is suited for Dark Slate Grey (`#2D3741`) and Teal (`#185B6C`) backgrounds.
  - On Bronze (`#AE824B`) or Light Brown (`#A26B38`) surfaces, use Dark Slate Grey text unless contrast analysis proves otherwise.

### Typography & Imagery
- **Headings**: Confident, distinct display typeface for strong headings.
- **Body**: Highly legible, clean sans-serif typeface.
- **Imagery**: Genuine project photos, prototypes, system diagrams, hardware setups, and team images. Avoid generic stock photos that erode trust.

## 7. Marketing Content, Messaging & Trust

### Messaging Strategy
- Lead with student outcomes: clarity of direction, achievable milestones, reduced stress, and technical competence.
- Demystify complex technical domains (AI, IoT, embedded systems) into accessible building blocks.
- Maintain ethical integrity: avoid unrealistic or prohibited academic guarantees (e.g. guaranteeing specific grades or automated completion). Focus strictly on **mentorship, technical guidance, and collaborative development**.

### Sample Marketing Taglines
> *"Have a concept but need technical direction?"*  
> *"Need AI, software, or IoT to work together in your project?"*  
> *"Let’s research the problem, plan the approach, and build with purpose."*
